# Scala learning

1. There will be no __null__ values.
2. Only __pure functions__ will be used.
3. __Immutable values__ will be used for all fields.
4. Whenever you use an _if_, you must always also use an _else_.
5. The “classes” will __not encapsulate data and behavior__.

_Functional programming is a way of writing software applications using __only pure functions__ and __immutable values__._

#### Pure functions

- _output_ depends only on __its input__ and __internal algorithm__
- _no side effects_, not read/write anything from/to the outside world  

#### Higher-Order Function (HOF)

- you can treat a function as a value
- you can pass that that value into other functions 

## Functional techniques

- Semigroup
- Applicative 
- Monad
- Monoid
- Functor
- Disjunction 

### Control flow (Railway Pattern)
